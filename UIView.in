    /* Override this method to tell the layout system that there is something it doesn't natively understand in this view, and this is how large it intrinsically is.  A typical example would be a single line text field.  The layout system does not understand text - it must just be told that there's something in the view, and that that something will take a certain amount of space if not clipped.

     In response, UIKit will set up constraints that specify (1) that the opaque content should not be compressed or clipped, (2) that the view prefers to hug tightly to its content.

     A user of a view may need to specify the priority of these constraints.  For example, by default, a push button
     -strongly wants to hug its content in the vertical direction (buttons really ought to be their natural height)
     -weakly hugs its content horizontally (extra side padding between the title and the edge of the bezel is acceptable)
     -strongly resists compressing or clipping content in both directions.

     However, you might have a case where you'd prefer to show all the available buttons with truncated text rather than losing some of the buttons. The truncation might only happen in portrait orientation but not in landscape, for example. In that case you'd want to setContentCompressionResistancePriority:forAxis: to (say) UILayoutPriorityDefaultLow for the horizontal axis.

     The default 'strong' and 'weak' priorities referred to above are UILayoutPriorityDefaultHigh and UILayoutPriorityDefaultLow.

     Note that not all views have an intrinsicContentSize.  UIView's default implementation is to return (UIViewNoIntrinsicMetric, UIViewNoIntrinsicMetric).  The _intrinsic_ content size is concerned only with data that is in the view itself, not in other views. Remember that you can also set constant width or height constraints on any view, and you don't need to override instrinsicContentSize if these dimensions won't be changing with changing view content.

    * When requesting a snapshot, 'afterUpdates' defines whether the snapshot is representative of what's currently on screen or if you wish to include any recent changes before taking the snapshot.

    * Creating snapshots from existing snapshots (as a method to duplicate, crop or create a resizable variant) is supported. In cases where many snapshots are needed, creating a snapshot from a common superview and making subsequent snapshots from it can be more performant.
